A powerful representation approach can unleash the potential of discovering new medical patterns underlying the EHR. Here, we introduce an unsupervised method for embedding high-dimensional EHR data at the patient level to characterize heterogeneity in complex diseases and identify novel disease patterns linked to disparities in clinical outcomes. We applied this approach to 34,851 unique medical codes across 1,046,649 longitudinal patient events, including 102,740 patients in the Electronic Medical Records and GEnomics (eMERGE) Network. The model achieved strong predictive performance in predicting future disease (median AUROC = 0.87 within one year) and bulk phenotyping (median AUROC = 0.84). Notably, these patient embeddings revealed diverse comorbidity profiles and health outcomes, including distinct subtypes and progression patterns in colorectal cancer and systemic lupus erythematosus."

Frequent ED utilization has been associated with mental health disorders. However, the association between social determinants of health (SDoH) and frequent ED use is not as well understood. Our objective was to identify associations between frequent ED use and mental health disorders and SDoH among patients visiting 19 Upper Midwest EDs in an integrated health system. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of adult patients presenting to the 19 EDs from July 1, 2020-June 30, 2021. Using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals obtained from multivariable logistic regression models, we characterized associations between mental health disorders (based on ICD-10 groupings) and 10 SDoH with frequent ED utilization (defined as ≥6 ED visits per year). A total of 228,814 visits among 134,452 patients were eligible for inclusion. After accounting for clinical features and mental health risk factors, the following had the strongest association with frequent ED use: unmet transportation needs (OR 1.73); high risk for financial resources (OR 1.52); food insecurity (OR 1.58); smoking tobacco (OR 1.31); and physical inactivity (OR 1.23). The top mental health risk factors for frequent ED utilization were adult personality and behavioral disorders (OR 4.0) and anxiety, stress and non-psychotic disorders (OR 3.35). We found strong associations between mental illness and SDoH and frequent ED use. The strongest SDoH risk factors included unmet transportation needs, financial resource risk, and food insecurity. The top two mental health risk factors were adult personality and behavioral disorders as well as anxiety and stress disorders, with differences that persisted when analyzed independently as well as when adjusting for other mental health risk factors. By understanding the interaction between social determinants of health and mental health disorders researchers can better address root causes and improve health outcomes among this vulnerable population."

Primary care often serves as a routine point of contact for patients following MBS and is a potential gateway for addressing and/or preventing recurrent weight gain. Although guidelines for the management of recurrent weight gain after MBS exist, this narrative review was undertaken to clarify the role of the primary care providers in enhancing long-term outcomes and preventing weight gain after MBS. Regular follow-up in primary care provides an opportunity to identify challenges related to weight management and overall health outcomes, which may include concerns related to nutrition, mental or physical well-being, body image, motivation, and behavior change, for example. The availability of multidisciplinary providers within primary care settings, including behavioral health specialists, dietitians, and physical therapists, is an important strength of this setting in addressing potential post-MBS concerns such as recurrent weight gain. This review outlines clinical considerations for managing recurrent weight gain post-MBS in primary care and includes recommendations for both primary care providers and specialty clinicians working in primary care to deliver care effectively and mitigate weight stigma post-MBS."

The study compares patient characteristics and urine metabolic profiles at the time of EH diagnosis and kidney stones and end stage kidney disease (ESKD) events during follow-up in a cohort with diverse causes of EH. Adult patients with newly documented elevated urinary oxalate excretion (UOX) >40 mg/24hr between 1/1/2010 to 10/31/2023 and a known enteric diagnosis including inflammatory bowel disease, Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI), Celiac disease, Structural Intestinal Malabsorption (SIM), or Malabsorptive Bariatric surgery (Bariatric) were identified. Event rates and cumulative incidence of kidney stones and ESKD were assessed. Among 814 identified patients, the most common enteric etiology was Bariatric (n=524, 64%). Patients with ulcerative colitis had the highest prevalence of kidney stones at EH diagnosis (93.6%) compared to other enteric etiologies (p=0.002). Patients with SIM had the highest urinary oxalate, lower urinary citrate, and volume, compared to other enteric etiologies (p<0.05). Calcium oxalate supersaturation was similar among the enteric groups (p=0.67). Median stone event rate for the overall cohort was 0.70 stone events/year during a mean (SD) follow-up of 5.0 (3.9) years. The SIM and EPI groups experienced the highest stone events (median (IQR) 1.24 (0.28, 2.40) and 1.20 (0.41, 1.99) events/year, respectively) while the Bariatric group had the lowest event rates (median (IQR) 0.45 (0.00, 1.66 events/year)) (p<0.001). The SIM group had the highest ESKD incidence (17.8% 5 years post-diagnosis; log-rank test p<0.001). We describe a large EH cohort from diverse enteric etiologies. Significant heterogeneity exists in patient characteristics, urine metabolic risk factors and adverse kidney outcomes. Patients with SIM and EPI experienced the highest kidney stone events and patients with SIM had the highest ESKD incidence. This study highlights the urgent need for more granular information regarding the natural history and risk factors for kidney complications for EH patients to support interventional trials to improve outcomes."

Adult patients with CS from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry between 2010 and 2023 were categorized into normoxia (Pa o2 60-150 mm Hg), mild hyperoxia (Pa o2 151-300 mm Hg), and severe hyperoxia (Pa o2 > 300 mm Hg) based on their Pa o2 at 24 hours. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. End-organ complications were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression models, and causal mediation analysis was performed to estimate the direct and indirect effects of hyperoxia on mortality. Multicenter, multinational prospective cohort study. Adults with CS supported on VA-ECMO. Partial pressure of oxygen at 24 hours after VA-ECMO cannulation. A total of 10,541 patients were included (normoxia: 48.4%, mild hyperoxia: 30.0%, severe hyperoxia: 21.5%). There was higher in-hospital mortality in patients with severe hyperoxia (71.7%, adjusted OR [aOR]: 2.17; 95% CI, 1.19-2.50) and mild hyperoxia (63.8%, aOR: 1.34; 95% CI, 1.19-1.50) compared normoxia (52.7%; referent group). Severe hyperoxia was associated with more end-organ complications, which incrementally predicted higher mortality (aOR: 1.42; 95% CI, 1.25-1.61). Mediation analysis demonstrated that hyperoxia primary exerted a direct effect on mortality (86%), with contributions from neurologic (3.1%), hepatic (3.9%), renal (3.5%), and bleeding (2.3%) complications. Severe hyperoxia in patients with CS receiving VA-ECMO is associated with increased mortality and more end-organ complications. However, most of the effect of severe hyperoxia on mortality occurs via direct effects, independent of end-organ complications. These findings highlight the potential direct toxicity of hyperoxia and underscore the need for strategies to optimize oxygen delivery in this critically ill population."

Prolonged water-only fasting followed by dietary change may offer an effective alternative, but its impact on body composition remains underexplored. This secondary analysis utilized dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess changes in fat-free mass (FFM), fat mass (FM), and bone mineral content (BMC) in adults [median (IQR) age: 62 (15) years with overweight or obesity. Participants underwent a median (IQR) of 14 (6) days of water-only fasting, followed by 6 (3) days of food reintroduction with a whole-plant-food diet and a subsequent maintenance period of 45 (5) days. Study visits occurred at baseline and at the end of each period. At end of fasting, FFM accounted for 74% of total BW lost during fasting. However, at the follow-up visit, the median (IQR) percentage change in total BW, FFM, FM, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass from baseline was -8.2 (5.2), -4.4 (5.6), -14.7 (8.9), -15.8 (12.8) %, respectively. At follow-up, FM loss accounted for 67% of the total BW lost. BMC remained unchanged across all study visits. This protocol produced sustained FM loss, specifically VAT mass, and FFM recovery, suggesting it may support effective weight management."

Tandem duplications often disrupt reading frames and cause gene loss-of-function, whereas interspersed (non-tandem) duplications are largely benign. When the configuration cannot be determined, current guidelines presume a tandem structure, leading to some laboratories automatically classifying such variants as likely pathogenic or pathogenic. This study evaluates the validity of this presumption for DMD, in patients with and without clinical indications of dystrophinopathy. We performed high-coverage long-read genome sequencing on 15 patients with intragenic DMD duplications. Four patients had clinically indicated dystrophinopathy testing, while in the remaining 11 patients, the duplications were detected without clear indications of dystrophinopathy (e.g., through carrier screening). All four patients with clinical indications had tandem duplications. In contrast, 64% (7/11) of the cases without such indications had interspersed duplications, with four subsequently re-classified as likely benign, two (likely) pathogenic, and one uncertain. These duplications were often complex, involving co-duplications or co-deletions with other regions. Our findings challenge the presumption that intragenic DMD duplications are predominantly in tandem. This highlights the need for a cautious variant interpretation approach, particularly in carrier screening and other settings where variants are identified without indications of dystrophinopathy."

From December 18, 2006 to October 15, 2020, we identified adults with sarcoma who were treated with anthracycline chemotherapy at our institution who had an ECG within 1 year prior to treatment initiation. Utilizing previously defined AI-ECG nomograms, we obtained age and ejection fraction (EF) predictions. Changes in AI-ECG age were correlated with chemotherapy tolerance (the rates of dose reductions, treatment delays, and early discontinuation). We measured the sensitivity and specificity of the ECG to predict an EF of less than 50% or 35% prior to treatment and compared how changes in the AI-ECG EF prediction related to changes in echocardiography-based EF. Forty patients met the eligibility criteria. Sixty-eight percent of the patients were men. The median age was 56.5 years (18-76 years). We did not find differences in chemotherapy tolerance between patients who had an elevated or decreased ECG age. There was a trend `toward higher rates of dose reductions in patients with high ECG aging (odds ratio, 5.13;  Overall, AI-based predictions on ECG tracings could be a way to monitor for decreases in EF during treatment with anthracycline chemotherapy. We recommend further studies to evaluate AI-ECG aging as a marker for chemotherapy tolerance."

Ischemia-reperfusion was induced in a rodent biceps femoris musculocutaneous flap through collateral ligation and arteriovenous clamping. We hypothesized that ischemia-reperfusion flaps would show greater tissue damage compared to sham. Male rats were randomized into ischemia-reperfusion (N=10) and sham (N=9) groups. The ischemia-reperfusion group underwent flap elevation, collateral ligation, 3-hours of arteriovenous clamping, and followed by reperfusion. Sham had flap elevation only. Perfusion was monitored using laser-speckle imaging, and flap discoloration was assessed with blinded-SKIN scores. Serum and the composite tissue (skin/muscle) were analyzed for injury on postoperative days (POD) 1 or 3. Clamping reduced perfusion (p=0.00), while unclamping increased perfusion (p<0.00). Over time, flaps exposed to ischemia-reperfusion were more ischemic (Estimate 0.39, p=0.02). At POD1, the injury group had higher serum creatine kinase (p=0.04) and potassium (p=0.00) than sham. The injury group had more muscle apoptosis (34.7% vs. 5.2%, p=0.03), myonecrosis (30.3% vs. 14.1%, p=0.04), and inflammation (13.7% vs. 4.9%, p=0.02) than sham; myonecrosis and inflammation persisted into POD3. Skin apoptosis and inflammation were similar. This model reliably reproduces ischemia-reperfusion injury with a 3-hour ischemic period followed by early reperfusion. Animals subjected to our technique showed greater tissue damage than sham, with muscle being more vulnerable than skin. Serum showed peak muscle injury at 24-hours, and histology showed myonecrosis and inflammation through 72-hours. This suggests that <24-hours reperfusion (e.g., critical-window) may serve as the optimal time for possible intervention."

How these benefits vary across lower levels of cardiovascular risk is unknown. We used nationwide claims data to emulate a comparative effectiveness trial and examine the heterogeneity of treatment effects of GLP-1RAs, SGLT2is, DPP4is, and sulfonylureas on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) among adults with type 2 diabetes and moderate cardiovascular risk (annualized MACE risk 1%-5%, estimated using the annualized claims-based MACE estimator). Among 386 276 included adults with type 2 diabetes, 25.2% had baseline ACME-predicted MACE risk >1% to ≤2% (lower-risk patients) and 13.3% had ACME-predicted risk >4% to ≤5% (higher-risk patients). By year 3 of treatment, higher-risk patients derived greater absolute benefit than lower-risk patients when treated with GLP-1RAs versus sulfonylureas (absolute reduction in the estimated rate of MACE of 3.1% in higher-risk patients and 1.6% in lower-risk patients), SGLT2is versus sulfonylureas (absolute reduction, 3.9% in higher-risk patients and 1.3% in lower-risk patients), and GLP-1RAs versus DPP4is (absolute reduction, 1.6% in higher-risk patients and 0.5% in lower-risk patients). The relative benefits for MACE were also greater in higher-risk than lower-risk patients with SGLT2is versus DPP4is (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.70-0.87] in higher-risk patients; HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.88-1.12] in lower-risk patients). Conversely, the relative benefits of DPP4is and GLP-1RAs versus sulfonylureas were greater in lower-risk patients: HR 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.81) in lower-risk and HR 0.91 (95% CI, 0.97-0.96) in higher-risk patients for DPP4is versus sulfonylureas; HR 0.67 (95% CI, 0.58-0.78) in lower-risk and HR 0.80 (95% CI, 0.70-0.93) in higher-risk patients for GLP-1RAs versus sulfonylurea. Benefits of SGLT2is and GLP-1RAs were comparable across all risk levels. Cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2is and GLP-1RAs exist across all levels of moderate cardiovascular risk, reinforcing the importance of choosing glucose-lowering therapies that can prevent MACE in all people with type 2 diabetes."

Patients undergoing total hysterectomies 18-55 years old performed for benign indications. Rates of urinary tract injuries were calculated for patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign indications with adjustment for prior pelvic surgery, laparoscopic surgical route and lysis of adhesions. Secondary analysis of concurrent cystoscopy, timing of injury repair, and presence and location of endometriosis was conducted. Intended reconstruction versus accidental injury of the urinary tract cannot be distinguished in this database. 41,901 patients underwent hysterectomy for benign indications, 5,268 (12.6%) for endometriosis. Rates of urinary tract injury ranged from 1.0-1.5%, including ureteral injury 0.4-0.8 %, and bladder injury 0.7%.

However, vHct defines a percentage of red blood cells (RBCs) to total BV; therefore, similar vHcts can reflect significantly different absolute BVs and RBC mass/plasma volume profiles. This analysis explores how quantitative measures of BV enhance vHct reliability as a biomarker in heart failure. A retrospective analysis was undertaken in 395 patients stratified by vHcts reflecting clinically heart failure-relevant cut points (35% and 40%). BV was quantitated by the indicator-dilution methodology using iodinated-131 labeled albumin. Kaplan-Meier analyses compared outcomes. Quantitative absolute BVs on average did not differ between vHct subgroups above or below cut points; however, the distribution of RBC mass and plasma volume profiles varied significantly. A normal BV profile was measured in approximately one third of cohort patients and BV hypervolemia in 58%, driven largely by plasma volume expansions (72% of cohort), all with similar distributions above and below cut points. In contrast, profiles of deficits in RBC mass (anemia) and excess (erythrocythemia) were more frequent below and above cut points, respectively, but not exclusively, with 14% of patients demonstrating contrasting RBC mass profiles. Kaplan-Meier analyses provided aggregate support for vHct to stratify heart failure-related outcomes but do not account for misclassified patients. VHcts lack capacity to discriminate absolute BVs or the variability in RBC mass and plasma volume profiles above or below cut points. Therefore, quantitative BV measurements are key to adding specificity to individual vHct values, which permits reliable identification of BV status, assignment of appropriate risk, and guidance in management."

(3) Among patients with active WM, the presenting parameters: advanced chronological age, low serum albumin, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, elevated β2M and the presence of TP53 alterations (TP53 mutation or deletion 17p) unfavorably impact the prognosis and should be utilized to risk-stratify patients into the HR category. (4) The panel encourages screening for genetic alterations at diagnosis, prior to initiating therapy and also with rapidly advancing disease or refractoriness to ongoing therapy, which might result from clonal evolution.

Age and sex-adjusted linear regression was performed to identify associations between metabolites and coupling metrics. Additionally, we performed a metabolic flux analysis using gene expression data from RV tissue in an independent cohort of 32 patients. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis was used to identify metabolites and reactions characteristic of the decompensated RV. RV-PA coupling was negatively associated with tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate levels. Specifically, plasma α-ketoglutarate and fumarate were significantly associated with all coupling metrics in both cohorts. Metabolic flux analysis indicated that decompensated RVs exhibited aberrant TCA cycle activity, including reduced acetyl coenzyme A entry and increased lactate elimination, suggesting a shift from the TCA cycle toward glycolysis at the RV tissue level. We identify an association between circulating TCA cycle intermediate levels and RV-PA uncoupling in 2 independent cohorts, and dysregulated TCA cycle metabolism in decompensated PA hypertension RVs, suggesting that aberrant TCA cycle metabolism could represent a hallmark of RV maladaptation in PA hypertension.

By overlaying the lived experience of AD through the eyes of individual PLWAD and their care partners with clinical outcomes, we offer an important framework in which to consider meaningful benefit in terms of symptoms, functioning, and outcomes. The PLWAD and care partner interviews and surveys of the What Matters Most (WMM) research program have identified treatment-related needs, preferences, and priorities of people at risk of or living with AD and their care partners across the AD continuum. A WMM conceptual model of disease-created and refined through interviews with PLWAD and care partners across the AD severity spectrum-includes 50 concepts across six domains (social life/activities, thought processing, communication, daily activities, mood/emotion, and general independence) considered important to all PLWAD and care partners. From the PLWAD and care partner perspectives, an increase in time to the onset, development, or worsening of the symptoms in any of these meaningful concepts was considered a meaningful benefit. No single commonly used clinical outcome assessment captures all concepts of importance, nor the importance of time in AD; considering the lived experience and priorities of individuals affected by AD is crucial to put the ""meaning"" in ""meaningful."""

We employed anchor- and distribution-based approaches to determine changes in scores corresponding to minimal symptom improvement. An opinion-based approach assessed expert clinicians' agreement on the meaningfulness of score changes through three clinical vignettes. Minimal symptom improvement for Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory total score ranged from -4 (over <1 month) to -11 (over 1 to 3 months) points. Greater symptom severity correlated with higher MCID estimates. The clinical importance of score changes was influenced by treatment duration, pharmacological side effects, and impacts on caregiver distress/time resources. The clinical meaningfulness of agitation scale MCIDs is influenced by trial-specific and clinical factors. Shorter trial durations and measuring caregiver distress/time resources enhance the clinical interpretation of agitation treatment outcomes. For the CMAI total score, the MCID was -4 points over shorter time scales and -11 points for longer time scales.Worse agitation severity was associated with higher MCID estimates.There was high expert consensus that a noticeable treatment benefit was not worthwhile if it occurred after 12 weeks or had no impact on caregiver/staff distress/time resources."

Both have been used to target a range of thalamic nuclei, yet the roles of these thalamic nuclei in focal seizure generation remain incompletely understood. Thirteen patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy undergoing intracranial EEG were consented to undergo investigation of thalamocortical networks. Sampled regions included cortical, mesial temporal, and thalamic brain regions. Visual and spectral analyses were performed to identify seizure onset patterns and correlate thalamic and cortical seizure activity. Thalamic ictal discharges were observed in all patients, including synchronous thalamocortical seizure onset discharges with distinct onset patterns. These onset patterns ranged from hypersynchronous spiking, low-voltage fast activity, ictal baseline shifts, to broadband suppression. Multiple thalamic nuclei were involved in ictal organization and propagation, with the specific nuclei depending on the cortical seizure network. The thalamus plays a crucial role in focal onset seizure generation and propagation, with distinct seizure onset patterns and nuclei involved. These findings support exploring a broader range of thalamic nuclei in epilepsy neurostimulation and have implications for seizure detection settings in intracranial sensing devices."

However, the role of atrial strain imaging for risk stratification of atrial arrhythmia in patients with Fontan palliation has not been studied, despite the high prevalence and prognostic implications of atrial arrhythmia in this population. We hypothesized that pulmonary venous atrial strain was associated with new-onset and recurrent atrial arrhythmia in Fontan physiology. This is a retrospective study of adults with Fontan palliation and no prior history of atrial arrhythmia who underwent atrial strain imaging by speckle tracking echocardiography (2003-2023). New-onset and recurrent atrial arrhythmias were ascertained from baseline encounter to last follow-up. Of 404 patients, atrial reservoir strain assessment was feasible in 329 patients (81%), with modest intra- and interobserver agreement. The median atrial reservoir strain was 18% (interquartile range, 13%-24%), and atrial dysfunction (atrial reservoir strain <28%) was present in 294 (89%). Atrial reservoir strain <15% was associated with new-onset atrial arrhythmia (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.59 [95% CI, 1.09-2.34];  Atrial dysfunction was common and was associated with new-onset and recurrent atrial arrhythmias.

Artificial intelligence (AI) could help address these challenges, but a summary of the performance of these tools is lacking. This narrative review of published literature describes the performance of AI tools that use data from ECGs and echocardiography to improve identification of CA and challenges that hinder adoption of these tools. Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria with sample sizes ranging from 50 to 2451 patients. Four studies used ECG data, 8 used echocardiography data, and 1 used both. The CA gold standard was typically defined as a CA diagnosis in an institutional or other database but the requirements for these diagnoses were heterogenous across studies, and many did not distinguish among CA subtypes. AI model development varied considerably, and only 4 studies included external validation. The ability of models to predict CA ranged from 0.71 to 1.00, sensitivity ranged from 16% to 100%, and specificity from 75% to 100%. Only 1 study reported model performance across strata of sex, age, race, and CA type. Persistent challenges to AI adoption include usability, cost, value added, electronic health record/information technology interoperability, patient-related factors, regulation, and privacy and liability. Published studies on AI for improved identification of CA show favorable performance measures but numerous methodologic and other challenges must be addressed before these tools are more widely adopted."

Here we used a fluorescence based live cell imaging screen to identify degraders that target exon 14 skipped hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET). MET is a known oncogenic driver. MET exon 14 skipping mutations (METex14Δ) are found in lung cancers and result in the loss of a degron that is required for E3-ligase recognition and subsequent ubiquitination, prolonging the half-life and oncogenicity of MET. Since proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are heterobifunctional molecules that promote target degradation by the proteosome, we sought to restore degradation of MET lost with METex14Δ using a MET-targeting PROTAC. We generated a library of sixty PROTACs of which 37 used the MET inhibitor capmatinib as the protein of interest targeting ligand. We screened this PROTAC library for targeted degradation of METex14Δ-GFP using live cell imaging.

However, the pulvinar has a large tissue volume, multiple subnuclei, and widespread cortical connections. It remains unknown whether electrical stimulation of distinct pulvinar subregions affects the temporal, occipital, and parietal areas differently. To address this gap, we delivered single-pulse electrical stimulation to the pulvinar and measured the resulting brain stimulation evoked potentials in twelve patients undergoing stereotactic EEG for drug-resistant epilepsy. Brain stimulation evoked potentials were parameterized across the occipital, temporal and parietal cortex. Stimulation of the lateral pulvinar elicited significant brain stimulation evoked potentials in striate and extrastriate areas that diminish as stimulation shifts towards the medial pulvinar. Conversely, stimulation of the ventral aspect of the medial pulvinar produced significant lateral temporal evoked potentials, which diminish with lateral pulvinar stimulation. We also found that stimulation of the dorsomedial pulvinar evoked significant parietal responses with limited striate/extrastriate and lateral temporal responses. These results demonstrate that electrical stimulation of specific pulvinar subregions influences distinct occipital, parietal and lateral temporal areas. Selective targeting of pulvinar subregions to maximize seizure network engagement may be essential for individualized treatment of posterior quadrant and temporal epilepsies."

We aimed to determine the long-term impact of simultaneous LT and sleeve gastrectomy (LTSG) in patients with obesity transplanted for MASLD. We analyzed patients undergoing LTSG using a single clinical protocol (n = 72), and patients with BMI >30 who underwent LT alone for MASLD (n = 185) in a multicenter retrospective cohort study. Follow-up duration was 4-153 (median 41) months for LTSG and 12-161 (median 75) months for LT. Outcomes included mortality, graft loss, BMI, metabolic syndrome components, allograft steatosis and fibrosis. Mortality and graft loss were not significantly different between the LT and LTSG groups. The prevalence of diabetes was significantly lower in patients undergoing LTSG vs. LT alone after 8 years of follow-up (p <0.05), while hypertension decreased from 61.1% to 35.8% in the LTSG group (p <0.01). Patients undergoing LTSG (average starting BMI of 45.5) experienced significant weight loss compared to baseline for >9 years (p <0.001), while no significant change was seen for the LT-alone group (average starting BMI 34.0). The incidence of allograft steatosis was significantly lower in the LTSG vs. LT group (p = 0.004). The prevalence of fibrosis was reduced in the LTSG vs. LT group 3-10 years postoperatively (relative risk ratio 0.46; p = 0.09). One patient in the LTSG group had a gastric sleeve leak and one required hiatal hernia repair. Severe gastroesophageal reflux disease occurred in 11.1% of the LTSG group; risk factors included pre-existing diabetes and gastroesophageal reflux disease. LTSG results in sustained weight loss, resolution of diabetes and hypertension, and reduced recurrence of steatosis and possibly fibrosis compared to LT alone. It confers no increase in mortality or graft loss. The optimal approach to liver transplant for patients with obesity and end-stage liver disease remains uncertain, especially given the risk for recurrent metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. The current study provides the first multicenter analysis of outcomes for patients treated with combined liver transplant and sleeve gastrectomy and includes an assessment of key outcomes of interest such as weight loss efficacy, recurrent steatosis and fibrosis, and diabetes, as well as reflux (a known complication of sleeve gastrectomy) in addition to assessing for sarcopenia prior to transplant. The results demonstrate that combined liver transplant and sleeve gastrectomy can be successfully adopted at multiple centers and provides long-term efficacy in managing both end-stage liver disease and obesity, which may be of interest not only for clinicians and researchers, but also for patients and policy makers."

Researchers, patients, clinicians, regulatory scientists, and payers discussed the state of the field as well as the future of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) convened leaders from academia and industry as well as patients, care partners, clinicians, regulators, and payers to discuss the topic of operationalizing selection criteria for clinical trials and the role of biomarkers.Well-defined Alzheimer's disease (AD) staging criteria are an important consideration in study protocol design.Staging criteria and biomarkers must be coordinated to yield high-quality clinical trial results that have meaning for patients with AD by selecting a population most likely to benefit from a specific treatment."

Patient surveys conducted among 46 patients in Zimbabwe during October 2022 and 105 patients in Ethiopia during June 2023 revealed a significantly higher prevalence of delays in seeking and reaching care in Ethiopia. This was in the aftermath of the Tigray War, which damaged the region's health care infrastructure and diminished the trust of patients. In Zimbabwe, there was poor awareness among patients and nonotolaryngologist providers of otolaryngology disease and care capacity leading to delays in seeking and reaching care. Patients in both countries faced delays in receiving appropriate care due to resource limitations, with Ethiopia's constraints worsened by the recent war and Zimbabwe's by consistent health care underfunding. The longest delays were observed in head and neck oncology care. These findings provide a foundation for understanding otolaryngologic care delays in these low- and middle-income countries."

The established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model was characterized by immunophenotyping, whole-exome sequencing (WES), and T/B-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies. In vivo AITL PDX trials were performed with elotuzumab, romidepsin, and rituximab. An AITL PDX mouse model that includes a coexisting EBV+ B-cell proliferation was established. We confirmed clonal identity of the engrafted T cells with the primary T-lymphoma cells. WES on DNA from xenografted sorted T and B cells identified eight and three mutations previously reported in the COSMIC database, respectively. Primary tumor cells could be passaged serially in NSG mice with an increasing percentage of monoclonal B cells that mimic the human condition in which the clonal B-cell component in some cases may mask an underling T-cell lymphoma. In this PDX mouse study, single agent elotuzumab or rituximab significantly improved mice survival. Survival was further improved when elotuzumab or romidepsin was combined with rituximab.

Although this is an important milestone in mitigating Alzheimer's disease progression, it is critical for emergency medicine clinicians to understand what anti-amyloid therapies are and how they work to recognize, treat, and mitigate their adverse effects. Anti-amyloid therapies may be underrecognized contributors to emergency department visits because they carry the risk of adverse effects, namely amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities are observed as abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging as computed tomography is not sensitive enough to detect the microvasculature abnormalities causing vasogenic edema (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-E) microhemorrhages and hemosiderin deposits (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-H). Patients presenting with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities may have nonspecific neurologic symptoms, including headache, lethargy, confusion, and seizures.

The use of EVs as biomarkers for diagnosis and as delivery vehicles for treatment in a wide range of human disease is a rapidly growing field in research and clinical practice. We hypothesized that electric fields (EFs) could influence the release and content of EVs. To examine this hypothesis, we developed a specialized bioreactor enabling cells to thrive in a three-dimensional setting, replicating in-vivo conditions amidst programmable EF environments. We established a three-step EV purification protocol to achieve high-density production of EVs. We also performed mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis on EV-carrying proteins and used high-resolution nanoparticle flowcytometry for single-vesicle analysis. Findings from this report suggest that electrical stimulation, employing physiologically relevant amplitudes typical in therapeutic deep brain stimulation, influences the release of EVs and their cargo content in a frequency-dependent fashion. This conclusion could carry significant implications for both fundamental biological understanding and medical advancements. First, it raises an intriguing question about how the endogenous electrical activity of neuronal and other cellular assemblies influence the production and composition of EVs. Second, it reveals a novel underlying mechanism of how therapeutic electrical stimulations can modulate EVs and treat human brain disorders. Third, it provides a novel approach to utilize electrical stimulation for generating desired EV cargos in a programmable setting."

These conditions arise from mutations in the β-globin gene, leading to defective hemoglobin production and resulting in anemia. Current treatments include γ-globin inducers (eg, Hydroxyurea), blood transfusions, iron chelation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation. Recently approved disease-modifying agents and promising gene therapies offer hope, yet their broad application is constrained by scalability challenges. Traditionally, research and development for β-globinopathies have focused on γ-globin induction. However, the ε-globin variant, which is active during early embryonic development and subsequently silenced prenatally, was once considered noninducible by postnatal pharmacological means. Recent studies indicate that, akin to γ-globin, enhancing ε-globin expression could compensate for impaired β-globin synthesis, potentially ameliorating the clinical manifestations of β-globinopathies.

For each case, four age- and sex-matched controls without epilepsy were identified. Records of cases and controls screening positive for ADHD were reviewed to confirm this diagnosis. Those with comorbid ADHD and CAE were further assessed to determine if the ADHD diagnosis preceded or followed the epilepsy diagnosis, as well as the impact of ADHD treatment on possible seizure exacerbation and long-term epilepsy course. Forty-one cases of CAE were identified and matched to 164 controls. ADHD was diagnosed in 17 children (41.5 %) with CAE and 12 controls (7.3 %) (p < 0.001). Compared to those without epilepsy, the diagnosis of ADHD in CAE was more likely to be made by a mental health professional than a primary care provider (p = 0.047).

Although ADCs can induce sustained therapeutic responses in heavily pretreated patients, they can also cause significant toxicity and thus require careful monitoring. The prototype ADC, ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is comprised of a humanized, monoclonal human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed antibody, trastuzumab, linked to the cytotoxic agent, DM1, and is used for the treatment of early-stage and advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. Liver toxicities, including transaminitis and nodular regenerative hyperplasia resulting in portal hypertension have been described. We report a case series of four patients who developed hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) during treatment with T-DM1. HPS is characterized by hypoxemia, portal hypertension, and intrapulmonary shunting, and it can be associated with severe hypoxic respiratory failure. HPS secondary to noncirrhotic portal hypertension occurring with long-term exposure to T-DM1 has not previously been reported. Four patients who received T-DM1 in our institutional cohort (n=230) developed HPS, which can be associated with severe hypoxic respiratory failure. Each patient diagnosed with HPS received >50 doses of T-DM1. Only one patient at diagnosis had resting hypoxia, while the other three patients became hypoxic with exertion only. Discontinuation of T-DM1 led to clinical improvement in hypoxia in three of the four patients. The spectrum of liver injury that occurs with long-term use of T-DM1 remains incompletely defined. As T-DM1 is approved for use in the management of early-stage operable and advanced breast cancer, awareness of HPS as a potential complication of long-term administration of T-DM1 is necessary. The emergence of dyspnea alone or combined with low oxygen saturation and signs of hypoxemia (clubbing or elevated hemoglobin) should raise clinical suspicion and prompt evaluation for HPS. Cancer care team members should be vigilant regarding the potential for new and serious side effects associated with novel targeted therapies, which may emerge years beyond initial regulatory approval."

The reduced costs of genomic sequencing have enabled the creation of biobanks containing in-depth genetic and health information, which have facilitated the understanding of genetic variation, penetrance, and expressivity, moving us closer to the genotype-first screening of asymptomatic individuals for Mendelian CVD. This approach could transform health care by diagnostic refinement and facilitating prevention or therapeutic interventions. Yet, potential benefits must be weighed against the potential risks, which include evolving variant pathogenicity assertion or identification of variants with low disease penetrance; costly, stressful, and inappropriate diagnostic evaluations; negative psychological impact; disqualification for employment or of competitive sports; and denial of insurance. Furthermore, the natural history of Mendelian CVD is often unpredictable, making identification of those who will benefit from preventive measures a priority. Currently, there is insufficient evidence that population-based genetic screening for Mendelian CVD can reduce adverse outcomes at a reasonable cost to an extent that outweighs the harms of true-positive and false-positive results.

However, data on the long-term outcomes of full thickness distal biceps injuries and their treatment are currently lacking. The purpose of this study was to report on patient demographics, injury characteristics, and long-term outcomes for patients with full-thickness distal biceps tears. It was hypothesized that complete distal biceps tears managed operatively would demonstrate robust clinical success at long-term follow-up. Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Patients with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed, complete distal biceps tendon rupture sustained between 1996 and 2016 were identified. Patients were cross-referenced with a regional geographic database. A total of 66 patients (3 female, 63 male) with a median age of 50.8 years (IQR, 41.5-60.4) and a median clinical follow-up of 14.7 years (IQR, 9.6-17.9 years) were included. Patients who sustained a full-thickness distal biceps tendon tear were likely to be in their early 50s, male, right-hand dominant, current/former smokers, and laborers with a history of traumatic injury during an intentional movement. Most of these patients had pain and supination weakness but no loss of range of motion. All included tears were treated operatively. At final follow-up, patients maintained a majority of near-normal range of motion (median total arc of flexion/extension 140° and supination/pronation 80°), excellent elbow flexion strength (91% of patients had full strength), and adequate elbow supination strength (76% of patients had full strength). The overall complication rate was 24%, with 16 out of 66 patients experiencing some type of complication between infection, rerupture, heterotopic ossification, reoperation, and nerve complications. Overall return to work was 98%, and 85% of those who returned to work did so without restrictions. Complete tears of the distal biceps were most common in patients 50 years of age, male sex, right-hand dominant, and current/former smokers. The most common profession was laborer, and injuries were primarily traumatic in nature during intentional activity. Patients managed operatively demonstrated high rates of success at long-term follow-up with respect to elbow function and clinical outcomes."

Though significant efforts have been devoted to investigating the application of machine learning algorithms in the EHR, efficient and powerful representation of patients is needed to unleash the potential of discovering new medical patterns underlying the EHR. Here, we present an unsupervised method for embedding high-dimensional EHR data at the patient level, aimed at characterizing patient heterogeneity in complex diseases and identifying new disease patterns associated with clinical outcome disparities. Inspired by the architecture of modern language models-specifically transformers with attention mechanisms, we use patient diagnosis and procedure codes as vocabularies and treat each patient as a sentence to perform the patient embedding. We applied this approach to 34,851 unique medical codes across 1,046,649 longitudinal patient events, including 102,739 patients from the electronic Medical Records and GEnomics (eMERGE) Network. The resulting patient vectors demonstrated excellent performance in predicting future disease events (median AUROC = 0.87 within one year) and bulk phenotyping (median AUROC = 0.84). We then illustrated the utility of these patient vectors in revealing heterogeneous comorbidity patterns, exemplified by disease subtypes in colorectal cancer and systemic lupus erythematosus, and capturing distinct longitudinal disease trajectories. External validation using EHR data from the University of Washington confirmed robust model performance, with median AUROCs of 0.83 and 0.84 for bulk phenotyping tasks and disease onset prediction, respectively. Importantly, the model reproduced the clustering results of disease subtypes identified in the eMERGE cohort and uncovered variations in overall mortality among these subtypes. Together, these results underscore the potential of representation learning in EHRs to enhance patient characterization and associated clinical outcomes, thereby advancing disease forecasting and facilitating personalized medicine."

Both stimulation modalities have been used in recent years to restore functions lost to spinal cord injury (SCI). Secondary outcomes examine participants' perspectives captured via the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) upon study completion to further understand their perception of SCS. Six individuals with SCI completed 12 sessions with one modality of SCS during supine and/or side-lying, seated forward reaching, and standing activities. Changes in volitional lower extremity movement, the number of points of contact needed at hips and/or knees to facilitate standing, and changes in seated forward reaching distance were used to quantify performance. The UEQ was administered to gauge participants' perspectives following use of SCS to enable functions impaired due to SCI. For all participants, performance of motor activities improved with SCS compared to without stimulation. Responses for the UEQ showed an overall positive perception of trialing SCS with rehabilitation to enhance motor functions impaired by SCI. Regardless of injury severity, location of injury, time since SCI, or SCS modality, all participants experienced gains in motor function in the presence of SCS combined with a condensed rehabilitation program. However, no evidence of sustained motor functions was found in the absence of SCS.

However, evaluation of the dysfunctional scapula is intimidating for most. Physical examination of the periscapular muscles is very rich, and a systematic approach provides the opportunity to establish a diagnosis for most patients. Conditions underlying scapular dysfunction include trapezius palsy, serratus palsy, brachial plexus injuries, muscular dystrophy, snapping scapula, pectoralis minor syndrome, congenital undescended scapula, and functional scapular dyskinesis, among others. Patients should be examined with their torso uncovered and assessed from the front and back. Inspection, evaluation of motion, and strength testing may be followed by certain examination maneuvers specific for each condition. The scapular assistance test may help predict the outcome of treatment for certain conditions. Plain radiographs oftentimes need to be complemented with magnetic resonance of the chest to capture periscapular muscles as well as an electromyogram with nerve conduction studies. Computed tomography is particularly helpful for skeletal abnormalities. Ultrasound is used to assess certain peripheral nerve injuries and to guide diagnostic and therapeutic injections. A focused evaluation of the scapula followed by a more specific and directed approach for each condition suspected will allow upper extremity surgeons to approach the evaluation of the dysfunctional scapula with much more confidence."

The transgender population has long been marginalized by society. Societal stigmata, fear to seek care, and dearth of provider knowledge regarding transgender health issues have caused disparities to widen. Gender-affirming procedures and hormone therapy affect the long-term reproductive potential of transgender individuals. While cost concerns and insurance coverage regarding oncofertility is a prominent area of discussion, the transgender community is often excluded. Sixteen genetically XY females, followed by their multidisciplinary transgender care teams, were interested in starting hormone therapy due to impending onset and/or progression of puberty. Their physicians were aware of fertility struggles after undergoing hormone therapy and therefore referred to urology. Sperm cryopreservation via open gonadal biopsy, testicular tissue cryopreservation (TTC), and semen sample (when age/maturity-appropriate) were discussed. Though requiring surgery, biopsy/TTC relieves patients of the psychological impact of semen sample production. Under IRB approval, 15 patients (median age 12 years, range 10-16 years) underwent TTC (Fig. 1). One patient (aged years) opted for semen sample. All patients had success with spermatogonial stem cells cryopreserved for future patient use. With more individuals beginning medical and surgical therapy at a younger age, fertility preservation discussions are essential but often overlooked, depriving these individuals the joy of becoming a biological parent. TTC can be safely done in pediatric populations, though research is necessary to expand beyond current experimental stage of tissue development."

Both convulsive and nonconvulsive status epilepticus are frequently seen, however the exact risk and type of status epilepticus depends on the underlying syndrome or etiology. The baseline degree of developmental impairment and EEG features characterized by background slowing and persistent, and at times, near-continuous high-amplitude epileptiform discharges can make a clearcut diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus, in a timely manner, very challenging. Furthermore, there is limited guidance on best management of nonconvulsive status epilepticus, and success of therapy is often suboptimal."

The endomyocardial biopsy remains the primary diagnostic tool but presents with challenges, particularly in distinguishing the histologic component (pAMR-H) defined by 1) intravascular macrophage accumulation in capillaries and 2) activated endothelial cells that expand the cytoplasm to narrow or occlude the vascular lumen. Frequently, pAMR-H is difficult to distinguish from acute cellular rejection (ACR) and healing injury. With the advent of digital slide scanning and advances in machine deep learning, artificial intelligence technology is widely under investigation in the areas of oncologic pathology, but in its infancy in transplant pathology. For the first time, we determined if a machine learning algorithm could distinguish pAMR-H from normal myocardium, healing injury and ACR. A total of 4,212 annotations (1,053 regions of normal, 1,053 pAMR-H, 1,053 healing injury and 1,053 ACR) were completed from 300 hematoxylin and eosin slides scanned using a Leica Aperio GT450 digital whole slide scanner at 40X magnification. All regions of pAMR-H were annotated from patients confirmed with a previous diagnosis of pAMR2 (>50% positive C4d immunofluorescence and/or >10% CD68 positive intravascular macrophages). Annotations were imported into a Python 3.7 development environment using the OpenSlide™ package and a convolutional neural network approach utilizing transfer learning was performed. The machine learning algorithm showed 98% overall validation accuracy and pAMR-H was correctly distinguished from specific categories with the following accuracies: normal myocardium (99.2%), healing injury (99.5%) and ACR (99.5%). Our novel deep learning algorithm can reach acceptable, and possibly surpass, performance of current diagnostic standards of identifying pAMR-H. Such a tool may serve as an adjunct diagnostic aid for improving the pathologist's accuracy and reproducibility, especially in difficult cases with high inter-observer variability. This is one of the first studies that provides evidence that an artificial intelligence machine learning algorithm can be trained and validated to diagnose pAMR-H in cardiac transplant patients. Ongoing studies include multi-institutional verification testing to ensure generalizability."

In epilepsy, the delayed effects of deep brain stimulation on seizures limit optimization. Single pulse electrical stimulation and the resulting pulse evoked potentials offer a measure network effective connectivity and excitability. This study leverages single pulse and high frequency thalamic stimulation during stereotactic electroencephalography to assess seizure network engagement, modulate network activity, and track changes in excitability and epileptiform abnormalities. Ten individuals with drug resistant epilepsy undergoing clinical stereotactic electroencephalography were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Each underwent a trial of high frequency (145 Hz) thalamic stimulation. Pulse evoked potentials were acquired before and after high frequency stimulation. Baseline evoked potential root-mean-square amplitude assessed seizure network engagement, and modulation of amplitude (post high frequency stimulation versus baseline; Cohen's  Thalamic stimulation delivered for >1.5 hours significantly reduced pulse evoked potential amplitudes in connected areas compared to baseline, with the degree of modulation correlated with baseline connectivity strength. Shorter stimulation durations did not induce reliable changes. High frequency stimulation immediately suppressed interictal epileptiform discharge rates in seizure networks with strong baseline thalamocortical connectivity. Pulse evoked potentials delineated the anatomical distribution of network engagement, revealing distinct patterns across thalamic subfields. Pulse evoked potentials and thalamic stimulation during stereotactic electroencephalography provide novel network biomarkers to evaluate target engagement and modulation of large-scale networks across acute and subacute timescales. This approach demonstrates potential for efficient, data-driven neuromodulation optimization, and a new paradigm for personalized deep brain stimulation in epilepsy."
